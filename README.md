# EXPLORING GLOBAL WEALTH: AN ANALYTICAL STUDY ON BILLIONAIRES
This is Final Visualisation Project I have done for the Data Handling and Visualisation module in my MSc Data Science course at the University of Hertfordshire. The analysis conducted on the Billionaires Statistics Dataset sheds light on global wealth distribution and demographic trends among billionaires. This report summarises key insights derived from the dataset, focusing on wealth concentration, top billionaires, sources of wealth, geographic distribution, and correlations among variables.
